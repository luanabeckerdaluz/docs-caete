Code Structure
==============

A set of algorithms and software packages has been specifically developed for processing drone (Module 1), health (Module 2), and climate (Module 3) data, enabling visualization and analysis in accordance with our technical–scientific concept, the HARMONIZE Instance. This infrastructure has been consolidated into the *Cube4Health* Python package, which integrates all modules required for data processing and publication through services such as GeoServer, BDC-STAC, and TiTiler. Building on this foundation, we will develop the *Cube4Health* Application Programming Interface (API) — a server-side extension that provides the same capabilities through a web service.


Python source code
------------------

Cube4Health is a Python package developed using version 3.10, which provides a set of scripts for processing and publishing data related to health, climate, and drone imagery, with a specific focus on the Brazilian context. The package follows protocols defined within each module, enabling the integration and analysis of data from various sources, provided they comply with these protocols. It offers an efficient solution for handling such data, facilitating the extraction of essential information for monitoring public health, climate change, and other environmental variables that impact population well-being.


Fortran source code
-------------------

The Cube4Health package is a Python 3.10 library that consolidates the functionality of previously independent algorithms into a unified, modular framework for processing and publishing health, climate, and drone-derived data, with particular emphasis on the Brazilian context. The package adheres to protocols defined within each module, ensuring that heterogeneous data sources can be integrated and analyzed provided they conform to the established standards. This structure supports efficient data handling and facilitates the extraction of critical information for public health surveillence, climate-change assessment, and other environmental analyses relevant to population well-being.
