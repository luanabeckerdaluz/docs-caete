Build and Run
=============

✅ Configure PLS on Fortran Code
✅ Compile extension modules using Makefile
✅ Configure caete.toml for your setup
✅ Download required input data
✅ Run model

A set of algorithms and software packages has been specifically developed for processing drone (Module 1), health (Module 2), and climate (Module 3) data, enabling visualization and analysis in accordance with our technical–scientific concept, the HARMONIZE Instance. This infrastructure has been consolidated into the *Cube4Health* Python package, which integrates all modules required for data processing and publication through services such as GeoServer, BDC-STAC, and TiTiler. Building on this foundation, we will develop the *Cube4Health* Application Programming Interface (API) — a server-side extension that provides the same capabilities through a web service.


Configure PLS on Fortran Code
-----------------------------

Cube4Health is a Python package developed using version 3.10, which provides a set of scripts for processing and publishing data related to health, climate, and drone imagery, with a specific focus on the Brazilian context. The package follows protocols defined within each module, enabling the integration and analysis of data from various sources, provided they comply with these protocols. It offers an efficient solution for handling such data, facilitating the extraction of essential information for monitoring public health, climate change, and other environmental variables that impact population well-being.
